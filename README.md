# sms_sender

An App that receives SMS and POST data to the server on client's behalf

## Overview

With the absence of the internet, the client sends data in the form of SMS. 
This app acts as a gateway which receives the SMS and POST the data on client's behalf
to the configured server.

This app uses FlutterNativeView together with RxJava 
to run a persistent headless service and execute dart tasks
in the background while the app is closed.
